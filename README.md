implementations of Android Things. 
There is no guarantee of correctness, completeness or robustness.

How to use the driver
---------------------

### Gradle dependency

To use the `mpr121` driver, simply add the line below to your project's `build.gradle`,
where `<version>` matches the last version of the driver available on https://bintray.com/tck-mobile/android-things-driver-mpr121/android-things-driver-mpr121.

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.tck.android.things:driver-mpr121:<version>'
}
```

### Sample usage

```java
import com.tck.android.things.drivers.mpr121;


Mpr121 mMpr121;


// Open device and set TouchEvent callback
try {
    mMpr121 = new Mpr121(busName);
    mMpr121.addTouchListener(new TouchListener() {
        @Override
        public void touched(TouchEvent e) {
            Log.d(TAG, "TOUCHED " + e.getElectrode().name());
        }
        @Override
        public void released(TouchEvent e) {
            Log.d(TAG, "RELEASED " + e.getElectrode().name());
        }
    });
    mMpr121.start();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


// Close when finished
mpr121.stop();
try {
    mpr121.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error closing
}
```
